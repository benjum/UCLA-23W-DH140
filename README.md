## Instructor:

Ben Winjum (bwinjum@oarc.ucla.edu)

## Office Hours: 

* Fridays 10AM - 12PM and by appointment
    * [Schedule here](https://calendly.com/bwinjum/dh140)

## Course Description
This course is a hands-on exploration of coding in Python with a specific eye towards how it can be used in the humanities.  In turn, we will also consider how humanities and a humanistic perspective can be used to inform the practice of coding.  Coding is both a technical skill and an art form.  It is a tool that can be used to explore and visualize many different types of data, analyze the flow of information and ideas, create novel forums and platforms for communication and expression, and produce products that can be used for tremendous benefit as well as tremendous harm.  We will learn how to speak grammatically correct Python, how to use libraries of Python code, and how to use Python to tell stories of our own. In the midst of this process, we’ll look at examples that include (but are not limited to) identifying patterns in literature, recommending new music to your friends, mapping urban inequities, and analyzing social networks.

## Learning Outcomes

During this course, you will:

* Develop proficiency with the programming language Python and with the tools that support code development and practice
* Demonstrate the value of data for discovery, exploration, and analysis
* Gain expertise in coding and data science practice and research
* Apply Python to critically describe, analyze, and visualize data in the context of the humanities

## Course materials & technology

The course materials will consist primarily of Jupyter Notebooks and online readings. The only technology requirement on your part is access to a web browser.

**BruinLearn:** 

* Assignment submissions and discussions will take place on the BruinLearn course site, accessible at [bruinlearn.ucla.edu](https://bruinlearn.ucla.edu).

**Jupyter Notebooks:** 

* All class notebooks will accessible through the Jupyter module on our BruinLearn course site.  This module will allow you to access a JupyterHub that has Python and all required packages already installed. 
* You are, of course, also welcome to download notebooks to your own computer and install everything locally -- as a back-up, all in-class notebooks will also be stored on the web at [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/benjum/UCLA-23W-DH140). 
  * Do note that you will still need to access and submit all assignment notebooks via the JupyterHub instance linked in our BruinLearn Jupyter Module.

**Online Readings:** 

* Each week there will be several readings of online content. These will provide context and stimulus for our coding activities.

## Evaluation

### Grading Breakdown

| Graded Activities | Percentage | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Discussion Posts | 10% | Weekly discussion posts on BruinLearn |
| Assignments | 60% | Coding assignments in Jupyter notebooks, approx 1/week 
| Final Project Assignments | 5% | Two preliminary assignments to prepare for the final project |
| Final Project | 25% | Culminating project demonstrating concepts learned throughout course |

### Discussion Posts

Each week, I will assign a reading and post a prompt or question(s) on BruinLearn, and you will be required to submit a short discussion post in response to it on BruinLearn by Sunday (11:59pm) before class. The post should be thoughtful and substantive but relatively brief, just a few sentences up to two paragraphs max in length. You’ll get full marks for completing a post that is on-topic. These posts are simply intended to get you thinking about the material. You are also strongly encouraged to read and respond to the posts of your peers, and we will discuss readings in the class after postings have been made.

### Assignments

Assignments will be the majority portion of your grade and consist of coding exercises, short answer questions that reflect on content, and preliminary work to get you moving smoothly towards your culminating final project.

They will be graded according to the following criteria:

* **Does it work?:** Unless you purposefully created code cells that produce errors to make a point, notebook assignments must run from top to bottom without any errors. Verify this by restarting the kernel and running all cells.
* **Does it work correctly?:** It’s possible to write code that runs ok but does not produce the intended results. The code should be bug-free.
* **Cleanliness:** Nobody wants to go through unreadable code! Make sure to document your work accordingly, providing markdown cells and comments throughout.
* **Thinking out of the box:** It is easy to copy an existing notebook and replace datasets and parameters to fulfill an assignment, but how well have you grasped the underlying concepts? This can be demonstrated by *applying* your skills in new ways rather than *copying* each step of a given assignment. For example, you may experiment with functions not demonstrated in class, or create your own workflow that borrows certain concepts learned in class to make them your own.

### Final Project

Your final project will revolve around a humanities-related topic of your choice. You will choose supporting datasets of interest, complete an exploratory data analysis, apply at least one of the coding methods that we discuss in class, and craft a narrative that presents conclusions drawn from the data. The final product will be a webpage report (1500+ words, not including figure captions) and a very short (~3-5 minute) presentation of your analysis.

These projects are to be completed by yourself (no group projects), though we will discuss the projects in class and split up into groups for some project-related work.

## Policies

Assignments and discussion posts

* These will be made available on BruinLearn on Mondays, under the Assignments and Discussions sections.
  * *Special Assignment Note:*
    * The Assignments section on BruinLearn will detail the Jupyter notebook that needs to be completed, but you will not submit any assignments on BruinLearn.
    * Assignments will consist of completing Jupyter notebooks that are posted and accessible under the Jupyter Module.  All notebooks will be submitted by a button inside the notebooks.
    * Assignment grades and feedback will be recorded via the BruinLearn Assignment section.
* Assignments and discussion posts are due by 11:59pm on the Sunday before the next class.
* Discussions should be submitted on BruinLearn, and assignments should be submitted by clicking on the Submit button in assigned notebooks.

Late Work

* You can have three days of leniency on any due dates without any penalty.
  * For example, you can turn in one assignment two days late and a second assignment one day late without any penalty.
* After those three days of exception, any late assignments will be marked down by 10% for each day late.
* If you have a special reason that prevents you from turning in work on-time, please email me so that we can discuss your situation.
* The one exception for leniency is the final project:  **Final projects are due by 11:59pm on March 20.**
  * I will not be lenient with this deadline, but if external circumstances prevent you from completing the final project, please send me an email to schedule a time that we can discuss your situation in-person (or via Zoom) so that we can work something out.

## Weekly Schedule

**Note:** Weekly content is subject to change and will be modified as needed based on class discussions, needs, and progress.

### Preparation

* Fill out the [pre-class survey](https://forms.gle/erY1a9oYoy8SSMeC8)
* Make sure you can log into the class JupyterHub via the Jupyter Module on BruinLearn
  * We will cover this during our first class.

## How to ask a technical question

Given the nature of the course, you may have many, many questions along the way. However, please adhere to the following guidelines in order to make consultations as productive as possible. Students who do not follow these guidelines will be asked to reschedule.

Before asking a question:

1. Close all open programs, restart your computer, then try your task again
1. Search google and stackoverflow for the topic/problem (for example, the name of the function you’re struggling with or the error message you are seeing)
1. Go back through the relevant lecture materials to look for any insights
1. Go back through the assigned reading materials to look for any insights

If the above steps haven’t solved your problem, post a question on Slack, send an email, or attend office hours.  When doing so, include the following information:

1. A detailed description of what you’re trying to do, why, and how
1. A complete [minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) of your code so far (never send screenshots of code)
1. What you’ve already tried to do to solve your problem and what you have learned from it (specifically, explain the results of steps 1-4 above, including relevant links from stackoverflow etc)

## Academic Integrity

UCLA is a community of scholars. In this community, we are all responsible for maintaining standards of academic honesty. As a member of the University community, you are expected to demonstrate integrity in your academic endeavors. You are evaluated on your own merits. I encourage interaction whil learning the material, but cheating, plagiarism, collaborative work on written assignments such that you are sharing answers, or other kinds of academic dishonesty are unacceptable and may result in formal disciplinary proceedings, which may result in suspension or dismissal.

**Don’t take chances.** Ask me if you are unclear about UCLA policy. Ignorance is NO defense. In addition, avoid placing yourself in situations which might lead me to suspect you of cheating.

**Alternatives to dishonest behavior:**

* **Seek out help.** Talk with me to see if there is special tutoring or other arrangements to be made.
* **Drop the course.** Can you take it again in the future when you might feel more prepared or less pressured?
* **See a counselor.** UCLA has many resources for students who are feeling the stresses of academic and personal pressures.

You have worked very hard to get here, so don’t cheat! You don’t need to. If you would like more information, please see the Dean of Students’ Office in 1206 Murphy Hall, call (310) 825-3871, or visit their website at www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu.

## Student Resources for Support and Learning

**Providing feedback to me:** I encourage your feedback at any time throughout the quarter about things that are helping you learn, or things that aren’t helping. Please communicate with me if there are ways that we can improve the course.

**Personal problems:** Sometimes, factors out of our control make it difficult to focus on schoolwork. If you are having a personal problem that affects your participation, please talk to me so we can create a plan. If you are not comfortable speaking with me directly, please utilize the other student resources provided below in order to understand how to best approach success in this course given your personal needs. Please do not wait until the end of the quarter to share any challenges that have negatively impacted you. The sooner we meet, the more options we will have to support your overall academic success.

**Academic accomodations based on a disability:** If you are already registered with the Center for Accessible Education (CAE), please request your Letter of Accommodation on the Student Portal. If you are seeking registration with the CAE, please submit your request for accommodations via the CAE website. Please note that the CAE does not send accommodations letters to instructors–you must request that I view the letter in the online Faculty Portal. Once you have requested your accommodations via the Student Portal, please notify me immediately so I can view your letter. Students with disabilities requiring academic accommodations should submit their request for accommodations as soon as possible, as it may take up to two weeks to review the request.
