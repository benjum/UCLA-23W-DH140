You can write text in these, and when you execute the cell, the text will get converted into something that looks like a small piece of a web page.\n\nWhile this cell is selected, click in the \"+\" icon in the icon menu above.  \n* This will make a new cell below this one.\n* The bounding rectangle showing cell selection will move to the new cell.\n\nChange the new cell to \"markdown\" and render your new web page text by:\n* Going up to the icon menu, and changing the \"Code\" in the dropdown menu to be \"Markdown\"\n  * Note that the new cell must still be selected while you do this.\n* Type the Enter key, and you'll get a cursor in that cell\n  * Or you can also click inside the cell to get your cursor in it\n* Paste the text of your web page code into the markdown cell, and execute the cell by clicking the \"Run\" button in the top icon menu\n  * This will cause the markdown cell to turn into your web page text"
